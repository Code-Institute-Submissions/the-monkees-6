The Monkees

In this project I created a website for the band named ,,The Monkees".
This is my first milestone project at "Code Institute"


The band is a 1960â€™s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. I have been given the following requirements:

    Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
    Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

The band has provided me with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:

    Photos of the band members
    A video clip
    Audio clips

Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.


Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
Existing Features

    Ebedded video - allows the users to watch a video clip from the band without go to a different webpage
    Embedded audio - allows the users to listen music from the band without go to a different webpage
    Contact - allows the users to contact the band, by having them fill out the from at BookUs Page
    Responsive Design - allows the users to use their mobile to watch the webpage


Technologies Used

    JQuery
        The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
    HTML/HTML5
    CSS/CSS3
    Bootstrap
        The project uses Bootstrap elements (for example: Grid System, Font Awesome) to make the development faster and to make the website look much better
    CDNJS
        The project uses CDNJS animations such as hover effects
    GIT
        The project uses GIT to be able to save different versions of the project
    


Testing(BE FILLED LATER)

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

    Contact form:
        Go to the "Contact Us" page
        Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
        Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
        Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment(BE FILLED LATER)

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

    Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
    Different configuration files?
    Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
