The Monkees

In this project I created a website for the band named ,,The Monkees".
This is my first milestone project at "Code Institute"


The band is a 1960â€™s rock band and have around 50 years experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. I have been given the following requirements:

    Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalog, and any new material as it becomes available.
    Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties.

The band has provided me with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website:

    Photos of the band members
    A video clip
    Audio clips

Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages.

The webpage was tested on PC and smartphone.
On PC I used the following browsers:
* Mozilla Firefox
* Internet Explorer
* Microsoft Edge

I tested the site on my personal smartphone which is a Huawei P20. I use the chrome browser on it.

I used the Firefox's Developer Tools to test the website on different screen sizes.
I made sure the website works on small, on medium and on large devices as well.


Deployment

First I created a local Git repository and commit every changes to there after I pushed them to my GitHub repository.

If you would like to run this webpage locally you must download these files into the some folder and you must open the index.html file.
